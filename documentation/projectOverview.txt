Problem Statement:

- Lack of freely available listening resources that teachers can use during their lessons 
- As a language student myself, listening to audio in French is pointless without a test/listening exercise  
as I am not actively engaging with the content

Overview of solution: 
- Use Youtube videos that provide transcripts to generate listening tests with Generative actively
- Provide instant and unlimited tests with targeted DELF/DALF levels

Technical Proposal:

Phase 0:
Output a listening test on a website

Phase 1:
Store listening tests in a database 
Allow users to select type of questions generated

Phase 3:
Allow users to log in to view all their past tests

Phase 4:
Turn listening tests into quizes that be retaken

Phase 5:
Expand beyond French

Phase 6:
Allow teachers to assign tests to students

- Create a web application that allows students to log in and view their listening tests
- Create a quiz for them and store their score and the test in the database
