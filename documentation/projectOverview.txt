Problem Statement:

- Lack of freely available listening resources that teachers can use during their lessons 
- As a language student myself, listening to audio in French is pointless without a test/listening exercise  
as I am not actively engaging with the content

Solution: 
- Use Youtube videos that provide transcripts to generate listening tests
